Legged bot

2 servo with feedback sensor
[_]+-+-

1. generate population of genotypes + one unique NEAT NN following the rules of genetic programing
2. each individu has a seq of moves in time
   - use neat NN to evolve the net [NEAT == genetic program?]
   - the seq is based on a sweep of the servo but are just values
   - neat could evolve the seq to add inputs or erase one or some
   - each sensor has dynamic value  
3. check the fitness of each seq in the population
  - evolve the population
  - each individu keeps a log in each seq numbers to knows in which inputs their go in the processed net they are using
4. check the fitness of each net throught out all its population generations
  - evolve the net
  - if net have the same structure use fitest individu/seq from another net
